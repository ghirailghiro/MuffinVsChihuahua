## Introduction to the Project
The project aim to classify a dataset composed of photos of muffins and chihuahuas using Convolutional Neural Network.

## Objective of the project
- Experiment with different network architectures (at least 3) and training hyperparameters.
- Use 5-fold cross validation to compute your risk estimates.
- Documenting the influence of the choice of the network architecture and the tuning of the hyperparameters on the final cross-validated risk estimate.

## Project Constraints
Images must be transformed from JPG to RGB (or grayscale) pixel values and scaled down. While the training loss can be chosen freely, the reported cross-validated estimates must be computed according to the zero-one loss.
